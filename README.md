# The API Every Web Developer Ever Wanted

### Made with .NET 8 ðŸš€

Welcome to **The Pointless Endpoints API**, the only API you'll ever need (or maybe not). Built for fun, frustration, and existential contemplation.

## ðŸ“Œ Available Endpoints

| Endpoint            | Description |
|--------------------|-------------|
| **/compareBooleans** | Compare two boolean values. Is `true` greater than `false`? Find out! |
| **/currentYear** | Returns the current year. Who needs a calendar? |
| **/isEven** | Check if a number is even. Odd numbers not welcome. |
| **/echo** | Echoes back what you send. Because validation is overrated. |
| **/divideByZero** | Ever wondered what happens if you divide by zero? This API delivers. |
| **/yell** | Converts your text to uppercase, because sometimes lowercase just wonâ€™t do. |
| **/meaningOfLife** | The ultimate answer. No guarantees, though. |
| **/whyAreWeHere** | Deep, philosophical insights. Or just a shrug emoji. |
| **/weatherToday** | Returns today's weather. |

### ðŸ’¡ Why does this exist?
Because sometimes, developers just need an API that does absolutely nothing useful. Enjoy! ðŸ˜Ž
